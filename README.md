# Deck-Duel-Game-Development

In this project, I designed and developed an interactive deck duel game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game featured a turn-based battle system where players strategically played cards which best matched the provided description.

I implemented core game mechanics such as card drawing, turn sequencing, and game state updates. JavaScript handled the game logic, while HTML and CSS were used to create the user interface with a responsive design. Additionally, I incorporated event-driven programming to ensure smooth gameplay and intuitive user interactions.

This project demonstrated my ability to develop browser-based games, implement complex game logic, and create visually appealing and interactive experiences using front-end web technologies.
